  <h1>Multi-Model OCR Extension - Privacy Policy</h1>
  
  <p>Last Updated: March 2025</p>
  
  <p>The Multi-Model OCR Extension ("extension," "we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and disclosed when you use our extension.</p>
  
  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  
  <p>Our extension processes images locally within your browser for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. It uses AI services from Google Gemini and/or Alibaba Qwen to perform the OCR functionality. Here's how we handle your data:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>API Keys:</strong> Your API keys for Google Gemini and/or Alibaba Qwen are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's secure storage. We never transmit or store your API keys on our servers.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Image Data:</strong> Screenshots or uploaded images are processed locally in your browser before being sent to the respective API services (Google Gemini or Alibaba Qwen) for OCR processing. The images are sent only to the API service you've configured in the extension settings.</li>
    
    <li><strong>OCR Results:</strong> Text extracted from your images is returned from the API services and displayed in your browser. We don't store or use this data for any other purpose.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="important">
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Your use of Google Gemini and/or Alibaba Qwen APIs through our extension is subject to their respective terms of service and privacy policies. Please review those policies for information on how these third-party services may process your data.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Third-Party API Services</h2>
  
  <p>Our extension integrates with the following third-party services:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Gemini API:</strong> When you choose Google Gemini as your OCR provider, your images are sent to Google's servers for processing. Please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a> for information on how they handle your data.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Alibaba Qwen API:</strong> When you choose Alibaba Qwen as your OCR provider, your images are sent to Alibaba Cloud's servers for processing. Please refer to <a href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/legal/latest/alibaba-cloud-privacy-policy" target="_blank">Alibaba Cloud's Privacy Policy</a> for information on how they handle your data.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  
  <p>Our extension does not retain any of your data on our servers. All processing is done locally in your browser or via the third-party API services mentioned above. Your API keys and preferences are stored locally in your browser and remain there until you uninstall the extension or clear your browser data.</p>
  
  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  
  <p>Since we do not collect or store your personal data on our servers, we cannot provide access to or delete data we don't have. However, you can manage your local extension data by:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Accessing and modifying your API keys and preferences in the extension options</li>
    <li>Clearing your browser's storage for this extension</li>
    <li>Uninstalling the extension to remove all locally stored data</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  
  <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>
